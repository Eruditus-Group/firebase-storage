Facebook Tab Boilerplate
=====================

A basic HTML/PHP facebook tab boilerplate.
It includes fan page gating and a simple language switch.

Requirements
--------------
You should have PHP 5+ installed on your server.
You need to have a facebook application set up to obtain an application ID and SECRET.
Your server should be equipped with an SSL certificate, since most of the users will have secure browsing enabled.

Basic Facebook setup
--------------
Simply set up a new application at http:s//developers.facebook.com, go to `Edit App`, then `Basic` > `Settings`.
Under `Select how your app integrates with Facebook`, point the following values to where your application is located:

- Canvas URL
- Secure Canvas URL
- Page Tab URL
- Secure Pag Tab URL

Under `Basic Info`, the `Site URL` should be within the same domain as your application.

The `App Domains` value should represent the domain name where your app is running, e.g.:
`yourdomain.com` if your application can be accessed via https://yourdomain.com/myapplication/,
or `localhost` if you are running your app on a local web server like MAMP.

**Auth dialog**

Doesn't need to be touched if all you're running is a facebook tab.

**Advanced**

Here you can add a description of your app, and define the countries where it can be seen.
Be sure to provide a link to your privacy policy and insert a valid contact email.

Facebook regularly publishes new breaking changes, so be sure to keep up to date with the latest changes via this URL:

Adding your application to a tab
--------------
Follow this link to assign the application you have created to a new tab inside your fan page.
https://apps.facebook.com/pagetabgenerator/

Insert your APP ID and select the page you want to add the application to.

After submission, the application will appear in a new tab of your fan page.

Usage
--------------
Just download this repository, and insert your content in the designated content areas of index.php.

In the `inc/config.php`, insert your APP ID and APP SECRET.
The Facebook SDK will require these values to make API calls on behalf of your application.

In line 17, we detect if the user is a fan of the page that the iFrame is loaded into.

In line 20, you can choose to detect if the user has a particular locale, such as `de_DE` for Germany.

In line 58, we distinguish between the German speaking users and international visitors to serve different content.

In line 120, we set an initial width (810px by default) and height for the application.
If your height should be dynamic and the iFrame adapt itself to the height of your content,
you might want to uncomment the function call `FB.Canvas.setAutoGrow()` in line 121.

However I haven't yet figured out why in Internet Explorer 7 this doesn't dynamically adjust the iFrame height.
